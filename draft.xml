        OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0

        interoperable and REST-like manner.

      <t>
        This flow is optimized for clients implemented in a browser using a
        scripting language such as JavaScript.  It makes use of XMLHttpRequest
        to allow Clients to authenticate users without HTTP redirection.

      <t>
        This specifications does not change the semantics of the OpenID Connect
        authentication flows.  It introduces a new endpoint to which the
        authentication request is sent and processed.

    <section title="Cross-Origin Authentication Endpoint">
      <t>
        The cross-origin authentication endpoint is used to authenticate an
        End-User.  Authentication is requested by sending an HTTP POST request
        directly from the Client, using XMLHttpRequest to the OP's cross-origin
        authentication endpoint.
      </t>
      <t>
        Use of the cross-origin authentication endpoint requires direct Client
        access to the End-User's credentials.  The credentials should only used
        when there is a high degree of trust between the End-User and the
        Client.
      </t>
      <t>
        Communication with the cross-origin authentication endpoint MUST utilize
        TLS.
      </t>
      
      <section title='Authentication Request'>
        <t>
          The client makes a request to the cross-origin authentication endpoint
          by sending the following parameters using the <spanx style='verb'>application/json</spanx>
          format with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request entity-body:
        </t>
        <t>

              REQUIRED. The type of credential used for authentication.  Value
              is case insensitive.

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The request MUST include additional parameters that are interpreted
          according to a credential type definition.

          The OpenID Provider MUST:

        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              ensure that the Origin header is present and that its value
              corresponds to the Client's origin previously established with the
              authorization server during the client registration process,
            </t>
            <t>
              verify that the client is allowed to use the cross-origin
              authentication flow.

      </section>
      
      <section title='Authentication Response'>
        <t>
          If the authentication request is valid and authorized, the OpenID
          Provider constructs the response by adding the following parameters to
          the entity-body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>

              REQUIRED. The ID Token containing claims about the authenticated
              End-User.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP response
          using the <spanx style='verb'>application/json</spanx> media type as
          defined by <xref target='RFC4627'/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the case of a cross-origin authentication request, the RP may
          already posess identity information about the user, such as a username
          or email address.  Furthermore, because authentication is performed
          directly between the Client and OP, without using HTTP redirection, it
          is not possible to prompt the user for consent to share protected
          information or verify the Client's identity and location to which
          tokens will be issued.
        </t>
        <t>
          Due to these limitations the OpenID Provider:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              SHOULD NOT add claims to the ID Token that were not otherwise
              revealed to the Client during the authentication request,
            </t>
            <t>
              MAY encrypt the ID Token so that it does not reveal any claims
              to the Client.  A token encrypted in this manner MAY be used by
              the client for session initiation,
            </t>
            <t>
              MUST NOT issue an access token or other credential that would
              permit access to additional information beyond identity claims.

    <section title="Session Initiation and Authorization">
      <t>
        Having authenticated an End-User, it is often desirable to establish a
        session and obtain authorization.  Session establishment enables single
        sign-on, so the End-User doesn't need to authenticate to the OpenID
        Provider each time they use a new app (unless required by authorization
        server policy).  Authorization allows the Client to obtain additional
        access to the End-User's identity information and protected resources.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order to ensure that the session is established in the same
        User-Agent from which the Authentication Request was sent, session
        establishment makes use of the Authorization Endpoint, using
        HTTP redirection, as defined by OAuth 2.0 and extended by OpenID
        Connect.
      </t>
      <t>
        Similarly, use of HTTP redirection allows the Client's identity to be
        verified, and consent to be obtained for authorization.  It also ensures
        that any tokens issued are delivered to the intedended client via a
        redirect endpoint or HTML5 web messaging.
      </t>
      
      <section title='Authorization Request'>
        <t>
          The client makes a request to the Authorization Endpoint in the manner
          specified by OpenID Connect.  If session initiation is requested, the
          ID Token from the Authentication Request is included as the value of
          the <spanx style='verb'>id_token_hint</spanx> parameter.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            The following is a non-normative example request that would be
            sent by the Client to the Authorization Server:

      </section>
      
      <section title='Session Initiation Validation'>
        <t>
          If, as a result of processing the authorization request, the OpenID
          Provider initiates a session, it MUST validate the id_token in the
          request received as follows:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>

              Verify the signature and/or encryption applied to the ID Token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The Issuer Identifier for the OpenID Provider MUST exactly match
              the value of the iss (issuer) claim.
            </t>
            <t>
              The OpenID Provider MUST validate that the aud (audience) claim
              contains its Issuer Identifier.
            </t>
            <t>
              The OpenID Provider MUST validate that the azp (authorized party)
              claim is present and that it matches the client_id value in the
              authorization request.
            </t>
            <t>
              The OpenID Provider MUST validate that the rfp (request forgery
              protection) claim is present and contains a verifiable identifier
              for the browser session, that cannot be guessed by a third party,
              including the Client.
