      <t>
        OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
        protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
        based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
        well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
        interoperable and REST-like manner.
      </t>
        
      <t>
        This specification describes a cross-origin authentication flow which
        allows Clients to directly control the authentication ceremony, initiate
        a session at the Authorization Server, and request authorization from
        the Authorization Server after the authentication ceremony is complete.

      <t>
        This flow is optimized for clients implemented in a browser using a
        scripting language such as JavaScript.  It makes use of XMLHttpRequest
        to allow Clients to authenticate users without HTTP redirection.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        This specifications does not change the semantics of the OpenID Connect
        authentication flows.  It introduces a new endpoint to which the
        authentication request is sent and processed.
