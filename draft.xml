    <section title="Overview">
      <t>
        OpenID Connect, in building upon OAuth 2.0, allows a service to delegate
        authentication responsibilities to a centralized authorization server.
        In many deployment scenarios, enabling single sign-on is a motivating
        factor for implementing OpenID Connect, as it allows a user to access
        multiple services without re-authentication.
      </t>
      <t>
        In some instances a service may have multiple domains that act as
        primary points of interaction with the user.  For example, an online
        retailer may operate category-focused sites at www.phoneshop.example
        and www.camerashop.example.  The pages on each domain present the user
        with a traditional login dialog, prompting for a username and password.
        Because the retailer maintains a single user directory, a single set of
        user credentials works on both domains.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order to improve the shopping experience, the retailer has decided
        to allow single-sign on by operating an OpenID Provider at
        login.shop.example.  As part of that deployment, the retailer should
        consider replacing the login dialog on each site with a single "sign-in"
        button that redirects to login.shop.example and presents a unified login
        experience.  In some circumstances, however, it may be desireable to
        continue to accept credentials directly on each separate domain.
      </t>
      <t>
        The cross-origin authentication endpoint offers a solution that can
        satisfy this scenario.
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Cross-Origin Authentication Endpoint">
      <t>
        The cross-origin authentication endpoint is used to authenticate an
        End-User.  Authentication is requested by sending an HTTP POST request
        directly from the Client, using XMLHttpRequest to the OP's cross-origin
        authentication endpoint.
      </t>
      <t>
        Use of the cross-origin authentication endpoint requires direct Client
        access to the End-User's credentials.  The credentials should only used
        when there is a high degree of trust between the End-User and the
        Client.
      </t>
      <t>
        Communication with the cross-origin authentication endpoint MUST utilize
        TLS.
      </t>
      
      <section title='Authentication Request'>
        <t>
          The client makes a request to the cross-origin authentication endpoint
          by sending the following parameters using the <spanx style='verb'>application/json</spanx>
          format with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request entity-body:
        </t>
        <t>

            <t hangText='credential_type'>
              <vspace />
              REQUIRED. The type of credential used for authentication.  Value
              is case insensitive.

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The request MUST include additional parameters that are interpreted
          according to a credential type definition.

            <t>
              set XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials to true, which will include
              cookies in the HTTP request and allow cookies to be set by the HTTP
              response.  Note that even with this set, browser policy may
              prevent this behavior.
            </t>
            <t>
              include cross-origin verification parameters in the HTTP request,
              such as those defined by Proof Key for Cross-Origin Requests by
              OAuth Public Clients.  Such verification allows a session to be
              initiated subsequent to the authentication request, in the
              scenario in which cookies are unable to be set in the HTTP
              response from the OpenID Provider.

            <t>
              ensure that the Origin header is present and that its value

              authorization server during the client registration process,
            </t>
            <t>
              verify that the client is allowed to use the cross-origin
              authentication flow.

      <section title='Authentication Response'>
        <t>
          If the authentication request is valid and authorized, the OpenID
          Provider constructs the response by adding the following parameters to
          the entity-body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code:
        </t>
        <t>

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP response
          using the <spanx style='verb'>application/json</spanx> media type as
          defined by <xref target='RFC4627'/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          When making use of cross-origin authentication, communication occurs
          directly between the Client and OP, without using HTTP redirection.
          Furthermore, clients implemented in a browser are public clients and
          unable to be authenticated.  These two limitations imply that it is
          impossible to verify the identity of the Client making the request.
        </t>
        <t>
          Due to the lack of Client identity verification, the Login Ticket MUST
          be confidentiality protected from the Client.  The Login Ticket SHOULD
          be exchanged by the Client at the Authorization Endpoint for an ID
          Token and/or Access Token and MAY be exchanged in a mode that does not
          require further End-User interaction.

    <section title="Session Initiation and Authorization">
      <t>
        Having authenticated an End-User, it is often desirable to establish a
        session and obtain authorization.  Session establishment enables single
        sign-on, so the End-User doesn't need to authenticate to the OpenID
        Provider each time they use a new app (unless required by authorization
        server policy).  Authorization allows the Client to obtain additional
        access to the End-User's identity information and protected resources.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order to ensure that the session is established in the same
        User-Agent from which the Authentication Request was sent, session
        establishment makes use of the Authorization Endpoint, using
        HTTP redirection, as defined by OAuth 2.0 and extended by OpenID
        Connect.
      </t>
      <t>
        Similarly, use of HTTP redirection allows the Client's identity to be
        verified, and consent to be obtained for authorization.  It also ensures
        that any tokens issued are delivered to the intedended client via a
        redirect endpoint or HTML5 web messaging.
      </t>
      
      <section title='Authorization Request'>
        <t>
          The client makes a request to the Authorization Endpoint in the manner
          specified by OpenID Connect.  If session initiation is requested, the
          ID Token from the Authentication Request is included as the value of
          the <spanx style='verb'>id_token_hint</spanx> parameter.
