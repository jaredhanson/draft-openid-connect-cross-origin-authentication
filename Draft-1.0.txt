               OpenID Connect Cross-Origin Authentication
     draft-hanson-openid-connect-cross-origin-authentication-latest

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification describes a cross-origin authentication flow which
   allows Clients to directly control the authentication ceremony,
   initiate a session at the Authorization Server, and request
   authorization from the Authorization Server after the authentication
   ceremony is complete.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification describes a cross-origin authentication flow which
   allows Clients to directly control the authentication ceremony,
   initiate a session at the Authorization Server, and request
   authorization from the Authorization Server after the authentication
   ceremony is complete.

   This flow is optimized for clients implemented in a browser using a
   scripting language such as JavaScript.  It makes use of
   XMLHttpRequest to allow Clients to authenticate users without HTTP
   redirection.

   This specifications does not change the semantics of the OpenID
   Connect authentication flows.  It introduces a new endpoint to which
   the authentication request is sent and processed.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Cross-Origin Authentication Endpoint

   The cross-origin authentication endpoint is used to authenticate an
   End-User.  Authentication is requested by sending an HTTP POST
   request directly from the Client, using XMLHttpRequest to the OP's
   cross-origin authentication endpoint.

   Use of the cross-origin authentication endpoint requires direct
   Client access to the End-User's credentials.  The credentials should
   only used when there is a high degree of trust between the End-User
   and the Client.

   Communication with the cross-origin authentication endpoint MUST
   utilize TLS.

3.1.  Authentication Request

   The client makes a request to the cross-origin authentication
   endpoint by sending the following parameters using the "application/
   json" format with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request
   entity-body:

   credential_type
         REQUIRED.  The type of credential used for authentication.
         Value is case insensitive.

   client_id
         REQUIRED.  The client identifier.

   The request MUST include additional parameters that are interpreted
   according to a credential type definition.

   The following is a non-normative JavaScript code sample that would
   cause the User-Agent to make an Authentication Request to the cross-
   origin authentication endpoint:

   var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
   req.addEventListener('load', function() {
     var data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
     // handle response
   });

   req.open('POST', 'https://server.example.com/co/authenticate');
   req.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
   var data = {
     client_id: 's6BhdRkqt3',
     credential_type: 'password',
     username: document.getElementById('username').value,
     password: document.getElementById('password').value
   }
   data = JSON.stringify(data);
   req.send(data);

   The following is a non-normative example request that would be sent
   by the Client to the Authorization Server:

   POST /co/authenticate HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Origin: https://www.example.net
   Content-Type: application/json

   { "client_id": "s6BhdRkqt3", "credential_type": "password",
     "username": "jane", "password": "s3cr1t" }

   The OpenID Provider MUST:

   o  ensure that the Origin header is present and that its value
      corresponds to the Client's origin previously established with the
      authorization server during the client registration process,

   o  verify that the client is allowed to use the cross-origin
      authentication flow.

3.2.  Authentication Response

   If the authentication request is valid and authorized, the OpenID
   Provider constructs the response by adding the following parameters
   to the entity-body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code:

   id_token

Internet-Draft OpenID Connect Cross-Origin Authentication     March 2017


         REQUIRED.  The ID Token containing claims about the
         authenticated End-User.

   The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP response
   using the "application/json" media type as defined by [RFC4627].

   In the case of a cross-origin authentication request, the RP may
   already posess identity information about the user, such as a
   username or email address.  Furthermore, because authentication is
   performed directly between the Client and OP, without using HTTP
   redirection, it is not possible to prompt the user for consent to
   share protected information or verify the Client's identity and
   location to which tokens will be issued.

   Due to these limitations the OpenID Provider:

   o  SHOULD NOT add claims to the ID Token that were not otherwise
      revealed to the Client during the authentication request,

   o  MAY encrypt the ID Token so that it does not reveal any claims to
      the Client.  A token encrypted in this manner MAY be used by the
      client for session initiation,

   o  MUST NOT issue an access token or other credential that would
      permit access to additional information beyond identity claims.

3.3.  Authentication Error Response

   If the authentication request failed End-User authentication or is
   invalid, the authorization server responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad
   Request) status code (unless specified otherwise) and includes the
   following parameters with the response:

   error
         REQUIRED.  A single ASCII error code from the following:

         invalid_request
               The request is missing a required parameter, includes an
               unsupported parameter value (other than credential type),
               repeats a parameter, or is otherwise malformed.

         unauthorized_client
               The client is not authorized to use cross-origin
               authentication or the origin of the request is invalid.

         access_denied
               The credentials are invalid or the OpenID Provider denied
               the request.

Internet-Draft OpenID Connect Cross-Origin Authentication     March 2017


         unsupported_credential_type
               The OpenID Provider does not support issuing an ID Token
               using this method.

         server_error
               The authorization server encountered an unexpected
               condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

   error_description
         OPTIONAL.  A human-readable ASCII text providing additional
         information, used to assist the client developer in
         understanding the error that occurred.

   error_uri
         OPTIONAL.  A URI identifying a human-readable web page with
         information about the error, used to provide the client
         developer with additional information about the error.

4.  Session Initiation and Authorization

   Having authenticated an End-User, it is often desirable to establish
   a session and obtain authorization.  Session establishment enables
   single sign-on, so the End-User doesn't need to authenticate to the
   OpenID Provider each time they use a new app (unless required by
   authorization server policy).  Authorization allows the Client to
   obtain additional access to the End-User's identity information and
   protected resources.

   In order to ensure that the session is established in the same User-
   Agent from which the Authentication Request was sent, session
   establishment makes use of the Authorization Endpoint, using HTTP
   redirection, as defined by OAuth 2.0 and extended by OpenID Connect.

   Similarly, use of HTTP redirection allows the Client's identity to be
   verified, and consent to be obtained for authorization.  It also
   ensures that any tokens issued are delivered to the intedended client
   via a redirect endpoint or HTML5 web messaging.

4.1.  Authorization Request

   The client makes a request to the Authorization Endpoint in the
   manner specified by OpenID Connect.  If session initiation is
   requested, the ID Token from the Authentication Request is included
   as the value of the "id_token_hint" parameter.

   The following is a non-normative example request that would be sent
   by the Client to the Authorization Server:

   GET /authorize?
     response_type=token
     &id_token_hint=ey...
     &scope=openid%20profile%20email
     &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
     &state=af0ifjsldkj
     &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com

4.2.  Session Initiation Validation

   If, as a result of processing the authorization request, the OpenID
   Provider initiates a session, it MUST validate the id_token in the
   request received as follows:

   1.  Verify the signature and/or encryption applied to the ID Token.

   2.  The Issuer Identifier for the OpenID Provider MUST exactly match
       the value of the iss (issuer) claim.

   3.  The OpenID Provider MUST validate that the aud (audience) claim
       contains its Issuer Identifier.

   4.  The OpenID Provider MUST validate that the azp (authorized party)
       claim is present and that it matches the client_id value in the
       authorization request.

   5.  The OpenID Provider MUST validate that the rfp (request forgery
       protection) claim is present and contains a verifiable identifier
       for the browser session, that cannot be guessed by a third party,
       including the Client.
