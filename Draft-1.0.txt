               OpenID Connect Cross-Origin Authentication
     draft-hanson-openid-connect-cross-origin-authentication-latest

Abstract

   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
   protocol.  It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User
   based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as
   well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
   interoperable and REST-like manner.

   This specification describes a cross-origin authentication flow which
   allows Clients to directly control the authentication ceremony,
   initiate a session at the Authorization Server, and request
   authorization from the Authorization Server after the authentication
   ceremony is complete.
